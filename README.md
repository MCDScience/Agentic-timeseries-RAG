# Agentic-timeseries-RAG

Agentic Time-Series Forecasting Pipeline | Python, LangChain, OpenAI, TimeGPT

Developed an autonomous agentic workflow using LangChain and GPT-3.5-Turbo to orchestrate complex car sales forecasting tasks.
Integrated Nixtla’s TimeGPT (a generative foundation model for time-series) to deliver zero-shot forecasting, significantly reducing the need for extensive domain-specific model training.
Implemented a RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) architecture to provide the LLM with contextual sales data, enabling the agent to interpret trends and provide reasoned explanations for predicted fluctuations.
